Possible research methods include (but are not limited to)
- [User interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) 
	- 4-6 participants
	- in person or remote
	- best for discovery and gathering historical information: "tell me about a time when..."
	
- [Usability testing](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/#usability-testing)
	- 4-6 participants
	- in person or remote
	- can be conducted with static or front-end prototypes
	- best for discovering users' comfort with a given task, content or flow issues, or where users struggle with achieving their goal within the product 
	
- [Card sorting](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/) 
	- 30-50 participants (note: requires a much larger recruitment pool to generate this many successful completions)
	- primarily remote, though moderated sessions can be conducted in-person or remote
	- best for discovering users' conceptual models of how ideas or products relate to one another, or for IA research where each page or topic is on a separate card.
	- In an open card sort, where participants sort the cards into categories as well as name those categories, this research can also provide insights into the words participants use to describe given ideas or products.
	
- [Tree testing](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack)
	- 10-15 participants (note: requires a much larger recruitment pool to generate this many successful completions)
	- remote
	- best for testing out the structure of a site or section to determine whether and how users can find where a given task or product lives within it. (This works really well as a follow-up to a card sort)
