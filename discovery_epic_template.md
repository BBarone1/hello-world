*The goal is to find the answers to these through discovery research with stakeholders & Veterans.* 

## Problem Statement / Current State

_What specific thing are we trying to fix?_

- ​

## Goal

_By addressing the problem in **Problem Statement** above, what are we hoping to achieve?_

- ​

## Background Information

- What is this product or program?
- Who "owns" this program within VA? 
- Politics & pain points of note? (Anything we should be aware of before diving in? Conflicts? Territory issues? Painful past history) r
- Are there relevant laws/policies that are relevant to this product? 
- What is the current state of this product? (Analytics very helpful here)
- Relevant timeline for product (if existing)? How long has it been around? Iterations? 

## Stakeholders

_It is expected as part of discovery that this list may grow. The goal is to have a complete list of all stakeholders involved and talk to as many as possible by end of the discovery sprint. Ideally, you might have a product charter in place with the stakeholder's buy-in shortly after discovery is complete._

- **Veterans** who have… (_list eligibility criteria here. Be specific_) 
- **Names of VA Stakeholder(s)**
- Other stakeholders at VA

## What do we need to learn from stakeholders?

_Can be written as questions or goals. See examples below. Notes from these meetings may be captured in comments or markdown files in gh in a meetings sub-folder._

- **VA Stakeholders**

1. What is the program? Who applies for it? Talk us through the application process. What happens after Veterans apply? 
2. What are your biggest pain points in processing applications? Do you routinely see the same issues? 
3. What are the non-negotiables in creating the forms? Is there specific terminology or legal constraints of which we need to be aware? What documentation do Veterans need to upload, if any?

- **Veterans** 

1. What are Veterans' conceptions and misconceptions about the program?

   ​

etc. _Include questions for all stakeholders._

## Discovery Plan or Discovery Components

(_These are some examples of things you might do during discovery, as needed. Each might be a ticket; capture synthesis, research notes, research recordings, in discovery folder._)

- Kick-off conversation(s) with [stakeholder A], [stakeholder B], ... : Led by **name of team member** on **Date(s)**
- Online research to learn XYZ [E.g. for VIC, we did online research to see how other gov-issued applications work, to learn how states verify identity & Veteran status, etc.]: Led by **Name of team member** on **Dates**. 
- Quantitative research to learn XYZ: Led by **Name of team member** on **Dates**.
- Stakeholder interviews with **whom** to learn XYZ: Led by **Name of team member** on **Dates**.
- Debrief: Led by **Name of team member** on **Dates**.
- Solutioning and craft discovery one-sheeter (see below): Led by **Name of team member** on **Dates**.

## Proposed Solution

(_This should be determined at the end of the discovery sprint after completing the discovery plan._ *Research first, solutions last!*)


## Key Decisions from Discovery

(_Use this section to document key decisions made as a result of discovery research._)

1. **Decision 1**: Short statement on what we decided and support with what we learned. As appropriate, link to tickets or .md files that fill in additional info. 
2. **Decision 2**: Short statement on what we decided and support with what we learned. As appropriate, link to tickets or .md files that fill in additional info. 

etc.
