# So you want to do some research?

## Purpose
1-2 sentences about what the product is and what you want to learn.

## Type of Research 
See [18F method cards](https://methods.18f.gov/) for some options. [@BenB - I'll flesh this out with our most frequently used methods shortly]

## Recruitment criteria
* Number of participants: (usability testing is usually 5-6, card sorting is 30-50, tree testing is 10-15)
* All participants must have or be:
   * (ex: MHV non-premium, 20% disabled - think about disability or service requirements that enable or restrict someone from using this tool or benefit)
* Some participants should have or be:
  * (ex: have used Vets.gov, have previously applied for Voc Rehab - think about people who would be able to use the tool or benefit but might have different previous experiences or knowledge that would affect their familiarity or understanding)
* Indicate if you're looking for a particular age range, geographic reach, or other demographics. (If nothing is indicated here, we'll strive for an even spread of ages, genders, branches of service, ethnicities, and geographic areas.) 

## Dates and Times You Would Like to Have Sessions
PM and mod should propose these to the recruiter. Make sure you have notetakers lined up.
Things to consider:
* When are your moderator and note-taker available? Their schedules dictate these slots.
* It's difficult for one person to moderate more than 3 hours of research in a day or 2 sessions back-to-back.
