## Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Natalie and we also have some colleagues observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well on the site. While you are going through the site, if you can tell us what you expect to do on each screen before you do it we can help you through any rough patches. We are especially insterested in places that you find confusing or challenging.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make improvements. I really won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on if we get stuck.

We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site which will help us capture everything you say accurately.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.

As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud so that I know what's going on.

Do you have any questions at this stage?

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]
